== Overview

[NOTE]
====
The documentation on this site covers new features and improvements that are currently only available in the open source https://github.com/oracle/coherence[Coherence Community Edition] (CE).

For complete documentation covering all the features that are available both in the latest commercial editions (Enterprise and Grid Edition) and the Community Edition, please refer to the https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/index.html[Official Documentation].
====

Coherence is scalable, fault-tolerant, cloud-ready, distributed platform for building grid-based applications and reliably storing data.
The product is used at scale, for both compute and raw storage, in a vast array of industries such as critical financial trading systems, high performance telecommunication products, and eCommerce applications.

Typically, these deployments do not tolerate any downtime and Coherence is chosen due its novel features in death detection, application data evolvability, and the robust, battle-hardened core of the product that enables it to be seamlessly deployed and adapted within any ecosystem.

At a high level, Coherence provides an implementation of the familiar `Map<K,V>` interface but rather than storing the associated data in the local process, it is partitioned (or sharded) across a number of designated remote nodes.
This partitioning enables applications to not only distribute (and therefore scale) their storage across multiple processes, machines, racks, and data centers, but also to perform grid-based processing to truly harness the CPU resources of the machines.

The Coherence interface `NamedMap<K,V>` (an extension of `Map<K,V>` provides methods to query, aggregate (map/reduce style), and compute (send functions to storage nodes for locally executed mutations) the data set.
These capabilities, in addition to numerous other features, enable Coherence to be used as a framework to write robust, distributed applications.
